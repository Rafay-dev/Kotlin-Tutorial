OVERRIDING:
    If a function or property with the same name exists in the child class then we need to override them in child class using 'override' keyword

    A child class can override te member function of parent class using override keyword. By overriding a function, a child class gives its own implementation to the already existing code of base class.

    Overriding doesn't mean that it will update the code in base class, the change is only applicable to the class overriding the function or its sub classes
