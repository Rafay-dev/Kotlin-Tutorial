    INHERITANCE:
    'Inheritance' is a feature using which a class inherits all
    the features of another class.

    The class from which the features are inherited is known as
    Base class, Super class or Parent class.

    The class that inherits the features is known as
    Derived class, Sub class or Child class

    Note: By default all classes in Kotlin are final, so you have
    to use the open annotation in the parent class, this tells the
    compiler that this class can be inherited by other class.

    Kotlin accepts only single-type Inheritance.
    A 'Child Class' can only have inherit only one 'Parent'
    class at a time

    Every Kotlin class has 'Any' as a 'super' class
