DATA CLASS:
    In Kotlin, you can create a 'Data Class' to hold the data. The reason why
    you're gonna mark a class as 'Data' is to let compiler know that you're
    creating this class for holding the data, compiler then creates several
    functions automatically for your 'Data class' which would be helpful in
    managing data.


    SYNTAX:
    - data class Student(val stuName: String, val stuAge: Int)
