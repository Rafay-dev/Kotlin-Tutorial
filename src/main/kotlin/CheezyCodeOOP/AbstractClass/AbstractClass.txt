ABSTRACT CLASS:
    An abstract class cannot be instantiated, which means we cannot create
    the object of an abstract class

    Unlike other class, an abstract class is always open, so we don't
    need to use the 'open' keyword


POINTS TO NOTE:
    1. We cannot create the object of an abstract class

    2. Property and Member function of an 'abstract' class
    are by default non-abstract. If you want to override these
    in the child class then you need to use 'open' keyword for them

    3. If  a Member function is abstract then it must be 'implemented'
    in the child class. An 'abstract' Member function doesn't have a
    body, only method signature, the implementation is done in the
    child class.
