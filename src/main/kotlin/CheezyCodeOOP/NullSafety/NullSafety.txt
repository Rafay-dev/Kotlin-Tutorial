NULL SAFETY:

    Kotlin compiler by default doesn't allow any types to have a value of
    'null' at compile time

    For Kotlin, NULLABILITY IS A TYPE. At a higher lever, a Kotlin type fits
    in either of the two.

    > Nullability Type
    > Non-Nullability Type

    To set a type as Nullable we need to append a '?' to the type.

    EXAMPLE:
    var a:String ?= null
