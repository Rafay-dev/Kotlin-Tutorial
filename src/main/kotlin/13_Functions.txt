PARAMETERS:
    The values which are defined at the time of the function prototype
    or definition of the function are called as parameters.

    These are used in function header of the called function to
    receive the value from the arguments.

    EXAMPLE:
    fun functionName(parameter){
        return parameter
    }

    val num: Int = 20
   functionName(num)

   // The value of 'num' inside function is called 'argument'
