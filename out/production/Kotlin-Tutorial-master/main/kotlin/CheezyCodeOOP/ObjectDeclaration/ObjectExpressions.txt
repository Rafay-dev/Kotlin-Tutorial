    OBJECT EXPRESSION:
        - The 'object' keyword can also be used to create objects of
        an anonymous class known as anonymous objects. They are used
        if you need to create an object of a slight modification of
        some class or interface without declaring a subclass for it.

        For Example:
        window.addMouseLister(object: MouseAdapter(){

            override fun mouseClicked(e: MouseEvent){
                // ..
            }
            override fun mouseEntered(e: MouseEvent){
                // ..
            }
        })


        Here, an anonymous object os declared extending 'MouseAdapter' class.
        The program overrides two 'MouseAdapter' methods: 'mouseClick()' and 'mouseEnter()'
